This is my best attempt at the Recommender problem in the problem set.

It is my finals week and did not have enough time to write test cases before needing to study for finals.

Run by doing:

./solution.py {teammate_id}

This will output the top three restaurants to reccomend to that teammate, ordered descending by highest rated.
